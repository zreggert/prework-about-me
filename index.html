      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a bartender looking to start a new career as a full stack
        developer. Bartendng has been a a lot of fun for the past 6 years,
        but, especially with the pandemic this year, I have been eager to
        find a new career with new challenges.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Alpharetta, Georgia.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am a blue belt in jiu jitsu and enjoy competing when I have the
        time. It is my favorite hobby and I hope to continue to train for
        the rest of my life. I also enjoy biking, hiking, yoga, and, most
        recently, bachata.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>My dream job is to be a developer for a company that is creating
        positive change in our world. After high school, all I was focused
        on was making money to support myself, but now I want my work and
        efforts to have more of an impact on the world around me.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in Atlanta, Gerogia, and have for the past 8 
        years.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I honestly never thought I would take this path, but with the
        pandemic I had time to start trying to learn a new skill. A few of
        my coworkers and bar regulars had been talking about code and once 
        my restaurant shut down I felt like it was something I should at
        least look into. Both of my parents are or were software developers 
        too so obviously when I mentioned wanting to learn code they 
        thought it was a great idea. I started with some free coding sites
        and eventually subscribed to one and began online courses. After 
        a few weeks of consistant studying I decided to take a bigger step
        and apply for this bootcamp. Learning code so far has been 
        challenging, but I have enjoyed the problem-solving process of 
        writing and testing code and the excitement of finally figuring out
        how to get it to run properly. A career in web development seems
        like it would be rewarding and a nice change of pace for me. Not to
        mention, the idea of working remotely is extremely appealing to me.
