      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am a bartender looking to start a new career as a full stack
        developer. Bartendng has been a a lot of fun for the past 6 years,
        but, especially with the pandemic this year, I have been eager to
        find a new career with new challenges.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I am from Alpharetta, Georgia.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I am a blue belt in jiu jitsu and enjoy competing when I have the
        time. It is my favorite hobby and I hope to continue to train for
        the rest of my life. I also enjoy biking, hiking, yoga, and, most
        recently, bachata.
