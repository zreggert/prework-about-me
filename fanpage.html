        <h2>About the Artist</h2>

        <p>John Sturgill Simpson is a singer-songwriter from Jackson, Kentucky whose
            music is strongly influenced by well known outlaw country artist such as
            Merle Haggard, Willie Nelson, and Waylon Jennings. However, while he is 
            known mostly as a country artist, Simpson's albums range widely from traditional
            country to rock and psychedelic and most recently bluegrass.
